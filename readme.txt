Create a dynamic Slider (carousel or fade) for Events and Locations with the default Events Manager arguments, using a simple shortcode.


== Description ==
> Requires [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/) (free plugin) to be installed & activated.

This add-on lets you create a slider (carousel or fade) for your upcoming Events Manager events and/or locations. It work just like as EM's native [events_list], but will show the content in a slider instead of a list. You can use the exact same parameters as you are already used to in Events Manager.
`[events_slider scope="future" category="3"]`

It supports all native Events Manager features:
<em>If it works in EM, it should work in this slider as well.</em> :-)

* Supports all native [Events Manager search arguments](https://wp-events-plugin.com/documentation/event-search-attributes/)
* Supports Event Placeholders and Location Placeholders
* Supports full HTML formatting
* MultiSite compatible: [events_slider blog="all"]

> The plugin core is based on [bxSlider](https://bxslider.com/).

**Support is technical.**
<em>I</em> make it work, <em>you</em> make it pretty.


== Localization ==
* US English (default)
* Dutch (included in the download)

The plugin is ready to be translated, all texts are defined in the POT file. Any contributions to localize this plugin are very welcome!
